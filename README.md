# airbnbReact

Using props in React, we got this awesome Airbnb clone.
To be able to install the app, you need to use VS Code. Create a project in React vite then copy the source(src) files. After proper installation, you will get the ones I put as Print Screen In the project directory, you can run:

"npm run dev"  Runs the app in the development mode. Open   http://localhost:127.0.0.1 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

See the section about deployment for more information:  https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project

It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. 

The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
